# ConsoleSpaceGame
The Space Game, that you can play in your IDE via console!

Use keys '←' and '→' to move ship, and press Space to shoot!

Field updates every 0,3 seconds, but take in mind that once you pressed any arrow key on your keyboard, spaceship will move in that direction until you press another arrow key! That way the game will be more interesting!

Hope you'll like it! =)
